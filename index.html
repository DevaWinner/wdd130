				Hello there! I'm an ardent full-stack developer, fueled by a burning
				passion for technology and innovation. My journey in the tech world is
				marked by my relentless pursuit of knowledge and the thrill of
				problem-solving. I spend countless hours honing my skills, diving deep
				into the intricacies of coding, and emerging with solutions that blend
				creativity with functionality. <br> <br>But my life isn't all about code! When I
				step away from my computer, I immerse myself in the captivating world of
				movies. From heart-wrenching dramas to adrenaline-pumping action films,
				I relish the myriad of emotions and experiences that movies offer. They
				provide a welcome respite from my coding endeavors and stir my
				imagination in ways that often feed back into my work. I'm also an avid
				reader, losing myself in the pages of a good book whenever I get the
				chance.

			<p>
				Abuja is the capital and eighth most populous city of Nigeria. It is
				situated in the central part of Nigeria, within the Federal Capital
				Territory (FCT), and is a planned city built mainly in the 1980s. The
				city was developed based on a master plan by International Planning
				Associates (IPA), a consortium of three American planning and
				architecture firms. The Central Business District of Abuja was designed
				by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange.
